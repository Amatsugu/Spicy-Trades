  description: An extremely rare and valuable stone and one of the hardest substances
    in the world. Revered as healing stones and used by royalty as jewelry. A well-cut
    diamond is worth royals more than an uncut one, but the process makes them slightly
    undesirable.
  tooltip: "Wow\u2026 a diamond! Looks pretty rough around the edges though. I wonder
    if it could be improved somehow\u2026 (uncut) Wow! A cut diamond! This must be
    worth a fortune. (cut)"
