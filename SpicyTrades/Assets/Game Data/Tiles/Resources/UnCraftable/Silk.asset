  description: A luxurious, smooth and comfortable fabric. Imported from regions beyond.
    Incredibly expensive, this fabric is lightweight, strong, and is excellent for
    warm weather. Worn by the extremely wealthy, but mostly used by the Church for
    decoration.
  tooltip: As the saying goes, "silky smooth to the touch". This must be worth a fortune.
    You can probably make some clothes out of this.
